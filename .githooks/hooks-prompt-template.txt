Please review the currently staged git changes and update the project documentation:

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md**:
   - Add a concise entry (maximum 3 sentences) under the "Unreleased" section
   - Follow Keep a Changelog format (https://keepachangelog.com/)
   - Use appropriate category: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, or Security
   - Describe WHAT changed and WHY, with relevant file references if helpful

2. **Update CLAUDE.md** (only if needed):
   - If the staged changes include build configuration, architectural modifications, or structural changes
   - Update relevant sections to reflect the new architecture/structure
   - Keep it concise and focused on high-level understanding

After making updates, stage the files with:
- git add CHANGELOG.md
- git add CLAUDE.md (if updated)
